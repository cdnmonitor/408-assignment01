### Notes:
* Everything is written in functions for sake of organization and for a clean main function.
  * this is a later edit, when I finished adding search by phone I realized how much more I had to worry about.
  * I added more formatting for phone number after that fact, but for the most part this is function focused code.
* Error handling sqlite3 connections:
